# Motivation
Recently I planned a trial bikepacking trip with my good friend Nate. We both wanted to try bikepacking without getting completely invested, so in lieu of buying single purpose bikepacking [bags](https://bikepacking.com/plan/tips/guide-to-bikepacking-bags/), I opted to go with a rack and panniers. This way, if I determined bikepacking was not for me, I could always use them for commuting and running errands around town, and likely even use them interchangeably between bikes. This is my experience with trying to fit a rear rack on a Carbon Fiber 2020 Salsa Warroad. There were a lot more complications than I thought there would be.

# Problem 1. No Rack Mount Points on the Warroad's Seat Stays
When I bought the Salsa Warroad, I hadn't really considered that I would want to mount a rack on it, however, soon after deciding that I wanted to mount a rack, I came to realize that the Warroad doesn't have mounts (or eyelets, I may use the terms interchangeably) on the seat stays. These are the points on the bike where the rack's struts are secured to the frame itself. I found this surprsing, due to the fact that the Warroad has six, yes _six_ 2-bolt water bottle cage mounts, including one on each side of the fork, and even one on the underside of the down tube. Apparently Salsa thinks I need half a dozen water bottles, but not a rack. Anyway, the lack of seat stay eyelets meant that I needed to find an alternative method to mount a rear rack. Thankfully, Salsa had considered this possibility.

Salsa makes products that are specifically designed for mounting racks on bike frames without seat stay mounts. They are the [Rack-Lock](https://salsacycles.com/components/category/collars/rack-lock), and the [Post-Lock](https://salsacycles.com/components/category/collars/post-lock). Both provide mount points allowing you to attach a rack to your frame, however The Rack-Lock doubles as a seat collar whereas the Post-Lock does not. This means you can mount the Rack-Lock on your seat _tube_ (in place of a traditional seat collar) and not only does it add mount points for your rack's struts, it also holds your seat post in place. The Post-Lock does not act as a seat collar, and is meant to be secured around your seat _post_ (in addition to a traditional seat collar) and should _not_ be used to hold your seat post in place. Both are good options, but I preferred to use the more multi-purpose Rack-Lock. Unfortunately, every local bike shop in Denver, and every major online retailer did not have the Rack-Lock in stock in the size I needed. This drove me to search for off-brand reproductions of the Rack-Lock, which is where Problem #2 comes into play

# Problem 2. A Carbon Fiber Frame with Bespoke Measurements
Carbon Fiber has the benefit of being both incredibly light and strong, however it's easy to damage, crack, or otherwise weaken your frame by using parts that aren't the right size, or by tightening proper parts too much. _Side note, This is why using a torque wrench is especially important when afixing parts to your carbon frame._ This fact also meant that if I wanted to find an off-brand replacement for Salsa's Rack-Lock, I needed to find one whose inner diameter matched the exact external diameter of my seat tube. I assumed it wouldn't be too difficult, given that many bike frames and parts are meant to be universal or at least somewhat interchangeable, however I was wrong. Finding an off-brand Rack-Lock for a 32mm seat tube proved impossible. A 32mm seat tube is apparently unique to Salsa bikes, as told to me by a friendly employee of [Pedal](https://www.pedalonline.com/) in Littleton, CO. That meant that by purchasing a product like [this](https://www.amazon.com/M-Wave-Seatpost-Clamp-Rack-Mounts/dp/B0775L5KTZ), with a inner diameter of 31.8mm, I would risk causing damage to my frame. I can only assume that this is a sales strategy by Salsa, so that once you purchase a Salsa bike, you are limited to purchasing mainly Salsa parts and accessories. 

At this point, I was nearly out of options, however luckily, I was able find a Post-Lock in the size I needed at [campfirecycling.com](https://www.campfirecycling.com/), a Brick and Mortar bike shop in Tuscon, Arizona, with a ecommerce site as well. This was not the ideal solution, but ended up being my best option given my time crunch.

# Problem 3. Obtaining a Rack to Fit my Bike
There are dozens of options when it comes to a rear rack, however, after the hastle of trying the Rack-Lock and Post-Lock, I opted to shell out the extra money for one of Salsa's racks. I went with the Wanderlust
