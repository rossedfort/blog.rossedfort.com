# Motivation
Recently I planned a trial bikepacking trip with my good friend Nate. We both wanted to try bikepacking without getting completely invested, so in lieu of buying single purpose bikepacking [bags](https://bikepacking.com/plan/tips/guide-to-bikepacking-bags/), I opted to go with a rack and panniers. This way, if I determined bikepacking was not for me, I could always use them for commuting and running errands around town, and likely even use them interchangeably between bikes. This is my experience with trying to fit a rear rack on a Carbon Fiber 2020 Salsa Warroad. There were a lot more complications than I thought there would be.

# Problem 1. No Rack Mount Points on the Salsa Warroad Frame
When I bought the Salsa Warroad, I hadn't really considered that I would want to mount a rack on it, and apparently, neither had Salsa. Soon after deciding that I wanted to mount a rack, I came to realize that the Warroad doesn't have mounts (or eyelets, I may use the terms interchangeably) on the seat stays. These are the points on the bike where the rack's arms are secured to the frame itself. I found this surprsing, due to the fact that the Warroad has six, yes _six_ 2-bolt water bottle cage mounts, including one on each side of the fork, and even one on the underside of the down tube. Apparently Salsa thinks I need half a dozen water bottles, but not a rack. Anyway, the lack of seat stay eyelets meant that I needed to find an alternative method to mount a rear rack. Thankfully, Salsa had considered this possibility.

Salsa makes 2 products that are specifically designed for mounting racks on bike frames without seat stay mounts. They are the Rack-Lock, and the Post-Lock. Both are version of a seat post collar, with integrated eyelets where frame bolts can be screwed in, however with one _very_ important distinctions. The Rack-Lock is _NOT_ meant to be used as a seat post collar, wheras the Post-Lock can be.
