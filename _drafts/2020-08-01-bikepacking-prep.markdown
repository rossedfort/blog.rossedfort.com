One thing that's bothered me during COVID is that I am not able to commute into the office. Yes, you read that correctly. I miss my commute.

I consider myself lucky to be able to say that. Since spring of 2017, I've been commuting to work via bike almost exclusively, with the only exception being days where there is too much snow on the ground. In that case, I'll take public transportation. I live just over 3 miles from my office, so the bike ride takes no more than 20 minutes, the only limiting factor being traffic lights. I've been riding the same relatively cheap single speed for 3 years, and only done about $250 worth of maintenence and upgrades (unbelievably, I've only had 1 flat in 3 years  of commuting, and it was a puncture). All that to say, when COVID hit, and I found myself missing my daily ~6 mi. ride, I decided to buy a new bike, and I couldn't be happier that I did.
